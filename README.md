# W.T_00014118_CW
This project can be called my very first in the development of web sites. The project is a site for an online competitive game league of legends, including a profile login page, a home page, a page with available character classes in the game, a page with updates available in the game, as well as a feedback page with developers. Unfortunately, due to the lack of experience in the project, there may be some problems with optimization on some devices, but most of them have already been fixed.
